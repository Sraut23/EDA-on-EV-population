# Exploratory Data Analysis On Electric Vehicle Population

The goal of this project is to analyse and visualise the Electric Vehicle Population dataset from Kaggle using Python (Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly).

Problem Statement:
The messy and unstructured nature of EV population data presents significant challenges for stakeholders in understanding market dynamics, consumer behavior, and regional adoption trends. This project aims to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset to uncover actionable insights into EV adoption patterns, demographic influences, and the impact of legislative policies. By addressing data inconsistencies and leveraging advanced analytical techniques, the study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving EV adoption and identify opportunities for optimizing EV infrastructure and policy-making.

The project involves the following steps:

Download the Electric Vehicle Population dataset from kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mzohaibzeeshan/electric-vehicle-population-data-messy-data" and convert it into a pandas dataframe Perform data cleaning/deal with missing values using Pandas and NumPy. Plot interactive graphs to understand the data using visual libraries like Plotly. Ask and Answer interesting questions from the dataset.
